    "## What is Machine Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "You've certainly come across people taking about Artifical Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). Often times these phrases are used interchangeably but they have different meanings. \n",
    "\n",
    "Artifical Intelligence is the broad field in computer science of creating intelligent systems. Obviously that can mean many many different things and depends on what you count as \"intelligent\". Overall AI is generally a blanket learn for research related to producing systems which can produce answers to problems without having to manually program the solution. \n",
    "\n",
    "ML is a sub-field of AI where the approach to producing an intelligent system is have a program \"learn\" a possible solution to a problem. Perhaps you know roughly what the correct solution should look like, but don't every variable. ML provides an answer by having a program learn those variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Where is Machine Learning Helpful?\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll find machine learning used in places where the solution to a problem is too complex to do by hand. To understand what that means, lets look at a sample problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Detect where in an image a stop sign exists\n",
    "\n",
    "For this example, I'll be using a few libraries, namely OpenCV. OpenCV is a computer vision library that treats images as matricies and performs matrix operations over them. We won't go into depth on OpenCV, but I'll point out from a high level what it is doing."
