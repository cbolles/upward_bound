    "So far we have manually been working with weights, biases, activation functions, and plugging in inputs. What you may have noticed is that there is a pattern to these operations with neural networks. Essentially these neural net operations are a series of matrix operations. With the rise in popularity of NN's and machine learning several libraries emerged to provide large matrix operation support and various ML functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "TensorFlow and PyTorch are the most popular with recent years seeing PyTorch grow as the go to ML framework. PyTorch has support for tensors (multi-dimensional matricies), NN construction, and learning processes. We will play around with some of the building blocks of PyTorch before we put it all together and make our own NN."
