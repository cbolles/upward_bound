    "Lets break down what is happening in the lines of code above. The code is using the `get` function associated with the `requests` library. \"Get\" actually has a special meaning in this context.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first piece to understand is that the internet as we understand it is built ontop of the protocol \"HTTP\". \"HTTP\" is an agreed upon way that computers can communicate. The protocol was designed around the idea of a \"client-server\" architecture. That means that a computer (the client) can open a channel and make requests against another computer (the server).\n",
    "\n",
    "HTTP defines a few \"methods\" which represent different kinds of operations that are supported, a few of interest are listed below.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Method | Purpose                                   |\n",
    "|--------|-------------------------------------------|\n",
    "| GET    | Request information from the server       |\n",
    "| POST   | Send new information to the server        |\n",
    "| PUT    | Update existing information on the server |\n",
    "| DELETE | Delete some information on the server     |\n",
    "\n",
    "There are others that you can find [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods), but we will mostly work with `GET` and `POST`.\n",
    "\n",
    "So now we know the code is making an HTTP `GET` request which means we are requsting information from the server. To identify which server we want to \"get\" from, we provide the URL. URL's follow the basic structure\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "<protocol>://<domain>/<path>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Protocol in our case is either `http` or `https` (secure). The domain is how we find out where the requests should be sent to, and the path represents what specific information in the server we want to access. The protocol and domain are a firm part of the HTTP protocol, but the path is flexible and how it works depends on the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, what we are doing above is\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Making an HTTP \"get\" request\n",
    "2. The request is following the HTTPS protocol (HTTP with encryption)\n",
    "3. We are making the request against the domain \"google.com\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Now lets look at what we get back"
